LARGE GDELT ARTICLES FILE (47GB)
===================================

Due to its large size (47GB), the raw GDELT articles CSV is NOT copied into this directory.

Original Location:
  C:\GDELT_Africa_Extract\data\archive\african_gkg_articles.csv

The file `02_aggregate_articles.py` in STAGE_1_AR_BASELINE reads from this location.

IMPORTANT: If you move or reorganize the project, update this path in:
  - STAGE_1_AR_BASELINE/02_aggregate_articles.py (line 59)

Alternative: The script processes this file in chunks and creates much smaller aggregated outputs.
You can skip running this script if you already have the aggregated outputs in:
  C:\GDELT_Africa_Extract\data\district_level\stage1\articles_aggregated.parquet (4.7MB)
